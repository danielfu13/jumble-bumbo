## Project Description

The goal of this project was to design a Social Network API where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and Mongoonse ODM. I used MongoDB database because it is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

  ## Installation 

  To install this application, you must have MongoDB installed. Copy the files from the repository and run `npm install` to install the package.json. Use the terminal to start the server and use Insomnia to test the API routes.
